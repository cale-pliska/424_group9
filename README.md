**Sprint Review**
What did you learn from doing our first sprint?
We learned that we needed to be much more active in our communication. Keeping each other up to date on our progress needs to be a priority so we can be efficient and stay on schedule. 

What did go well? Why?
We did a great job assigning roles and responsibilities for this sprint. We had different people focus on different aspects of the project, which allowed us to make some great progress.
We did a better job of communicating during this sprint. We got into an effective routine for scheduling meetings which increased our productivity.
Our troubleshooting was strong. We were able to work together to overcome some difficulties setting up PHP.

What didn’t go well? Why not?
We struggled at first with PHP because we did not have much prior experience with it
How can you make things better next time?
We can be more detailed in our planning with specific success criteria for some of our tasks.
Are you satisfied with what you already completed?
Yes, we made great progress and improved our performance and consistency since Sprint 1 despite having some trouble-shootings.
Which group was invited? Everybody was present?
We met with group 3. Everyone in each group was present. We discussed updates on their website page, tasks and burn down chart. It was helpful to see their progress and discuss related issues
